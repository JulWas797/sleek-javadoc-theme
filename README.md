# Sleek (Javadoc Theme)
*Modern look for a modern code*

#### Note
> I've made a lot of projects on my GitHub previously, that are now privated due to the fact that they didn't meet my quality standards, including this one. Since the Javadocs are notoriously known to look outdated at least, I've made a decision to unprivate this project temportarily until I make a new, proper theme.
> <br> For now, enjoy 😉

### Why?
Current theme used in JavaDocs has been left unchanged since Java SE 1.8. <br>
This project aims to change it, by replacing the old styles with brand new ones.

### What's the difference?
- ⌨️ New fonts (Source Code Pro and Roboto)
- 👔 Elegant design based on subtle gradients
- 🎨 New color palette, inspired by skeuomorphism

### How it looks?
